# ZwiftWorldSelector

This is a very simple application for the Mac and PC that allows you to select which world (Watopia, Richmond, London or the current scheduled location) without haveing to mess about with your xml prefs file, or even worse, change your system date (not recommended).

If you encounter any issues please feel free to drop them in the Issues section of this Github Repository

## Installation instructions :

Select the latest version from the Distributions folder, download the package and install.

The latest PC Version is here [Release 1.0](https://github.com/RichLinnell/ZwiftWorldSelector/tree/master/Distributions/PC%20Version%201.0.0)
The latest Mac Version is here [Release 1.0.1](https://github.com/RichLinnell/ZwiftWorldSelector/tree/master/Distributions/Mac)

**MAC Users - Please note** - Apple Gatekeeper is still refusing to recognise my app developer signature certificates, regardless of how much I pay Apple,  so it will tell you that the application can't be opened as it is from an "Unidentified Developer" - let me help you out I am the developer, me, I'm here, the bald bloke from Birmingham in the corner!

To get the app to install download the package and then Press the Control key, then click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu.

I am desparately trying to get this to work in the correct, signed way, but Apple seem to hate me and only love my money.
